Note assignments to `x`, `y`, and `z`. `val` means identifier may not be on the left hand side of another assignment statement.

Note also that the declarations don't explicitly specify the type of the identifiers `x`, `y`, or `z`. Scala is statically typed,
but the type `Int` is _inferred_ from the type of the expression on the right hand side of the initizializer.

Similarly, the return type of the `readInt()` function is inferred from the type of the expression it returns.
As in many functional languages, the last expression in a sequence of expressions is the value of the sequence,
so the return value of function is the last expression in the function body.
